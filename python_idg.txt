0.About python
Created in 1989 by Guido Van Rossum
What is Python 
-Multi-purpose (Web, GUI,Scripting, etc.) 
-Object Oriented 
-Interpreted 
-Strongly typed and Dynamically typed
-Focus on readability and productivity 
In simple words....
A readable, dynamic, pleasant, flexible, fast and powerful language!

Code is written and then directly executed by an interpreter

The type of a variable is interpreted at runtime(so dynamically typed) and not at compile time...bcoz there is no compiler :P
(Tell later)A uni-typed language... tags are associated with the operands!


1. Installing python

2.Python2 vs Python3
>>The basic gist of the state of things is as follows:
    -Python 2.7 has been the standard for a long time.
    -Python 3 introduced major changes to the language, which many developers are unhappy with.
    -Python 2.7 will receive necessary security updates until 2020.
    -Python 3 is continually evolving, like Python 2 did in years past.

>>Use Python 3 if...
    You don’t care.
    You love Python 3.
    You are indifferent towards 2 vs 3.
    You don’t know which one to use.
    You embrace change.
>>Use Python 2 if...
    You love Python 2 and are saddened by the future being Python 3.
    The stability requirements of your software would be improved by a language and runtime that never changes.
    Software that you depend on requires it.


3. Installing pip
Pypi (python package index is a repository of softwares written for python)
